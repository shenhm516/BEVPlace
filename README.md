# BEVPlace++: Fast, Robust, and Lightweight LiDAR Global Localization for Unmanned Ground Vehicles
BEVPlace++ is a LiDAR-based global localization method. It projects point clouds into Bird's-eye View (BEV) images and generates global features with a rotation equivariant module and the NetVLAD. It sequentially performs place recognition and pose estimation to achieve complete global localization. Experiments show that BEVPlace++ significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and generalizes well to previously unseen environments. BEVPlace++ will certainly benefit various applications, including loop closure detection, global localization, and SLAM. Please feel free to use and enjoy it!

# Quick Start

1. Download the dataset from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oNthUKg4ysrbZ_sEjiylON9w93KCUT5/view?usp=drive_link). Unzip and move the files into the "data" directory.

2. Create a conda environment and install Pytorch according to your Cuda version. Then install the dependencies by 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. You can train and evaluate BEVPlace++ by simply running
```
python main.py --mode=train
python main.py --mode=test --load_from=/path/to/your/checkpoint/directory
```


# Evaluate your own data
Organize your own data following the description in [data.md](./data/data.md) and custom you dataloader following kitti_dataset.py. Then evaluate the performance with the script main.py
